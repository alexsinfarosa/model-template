The blueberry maggot degree day model is based on a model from Michigan State University, developed by Rufus Isaacs and Carlos Garcia-Salazar.

The NEWA tool was built by [Juliet Carroll](jec3@cornell.edu) and [Greg Loeb](gme1@cornell.edu), Cornell University, with input from Dean Polk, Rutgers University, and Hannah Burrack, North Carolina State University.
